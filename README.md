# mdql

A macOS Quick Look extension for previewing Markdown files. Press Space on any `.md` file in Finder to see a rendered preview — with **live updates** as the file changes.

## Features

- **Live preview** — edit a Markdown file and watch the QuickLook preview update in real-time
- **GitHub Flavored Markdown** — tables, task lists, strikethrough, fenced code blocks with language hints
- **Light & dark mode** — automatically follows system appearance
- **Inkpad-inspired styling** — clean typography with thoughtful spacing and color tokens
- **Fast** — uses Apple's [swift-markdown](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-markdown) (cmark-gfm) for native-speed parsing

## Install

1. Open `mdql.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Build & Run (Cmd+R)
3. Copy the built app to `~/Applications`:
   ```bash
   cp -R ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/mdql-*/Build/Products/Debug/mdql.app ~/Applications/mdql.app
   qlmanage -r
   ```
4. Press Space on any `.md` file in Finder

## Build

```bash
xcodebuild -project mdql.xcodeproj -scheme mdql -destination 'platform=macOS' build
```

## Test

```bash
xcodebuild -project mdql.xcodeproj -scheme mdql -destination 'platform=macOS' test
```

## How Live Updates Work

Getting live-updating QuickLook previews on macOS is surprisingly difficult. QuickLook extensions run in a strict sandbox, and the obvious approaches all fail. Here's what we learned and how we solved it.

### The problem

By default, QuickLook extensions use **data-based previews** (`QLIsDataBasedPreview=true`): the extension returns an HTML blob once, QuickLook renders it, and that's it. The preview is a static snapshot — if the file changes, nothing happens until the user closes and re-opens the preview.

### What doesn't work

We tried every approach we could find. None of them work inside the QuickLook extension sandbox:

- **WKWebView** — The modern WebKit view spawns separate XPC subprocesses (WebContent, GPU, Networking) that the sandbox blocks. The view loads but renders blank. Adding `com.apple.security.temporary-exception.mach-lookup.global-name` entitlements doesn't help because these are XPC services, not Mach services.

- **JavaScript polling** — Embedding `fetch()`, `XMLHttpRequest`, or `EventSource` in the HTML to poll for changes. The sandbox blocks all network access from the WebView, including `file://` URLs and `http://127.0.0.1`.

- **NSAttributedString(html:)** — Renders HTML in-process (no sandbox issues), but its CSS engine is extremely limited. No CSS custom properties (`var()`), no `@media` queries, no advanced selectors. Our stylesheet renders with broken fonts, colors, and layout.

- **Embedded HTTP server** — Running an `NWListener` inside the extension to serve updated content. The sandbox denies `networkd.plist` access and the port stays at 0.

- **localStorage / WebSocket / SSE** — All blocked by the sandbox.

### What works: legacy WebView + DispatchSource FileWatcher

The solution uses three components working together:

**1. View-based preview (`QLIsDataBasedPreview=false`)**

Instead of returning data, the extension provides an `NSView` that stays alive for the lifetime of the QuickLook panel. This is the key enabler — it gives us a persistent view we can update.

```swift
// PreviewController uses preparePreviewOfFile(at:completionHandler:)
// instead of providePreview(for:) — the view IS the preview
func preparePreviewOfFile(at url: URL, completionHandler handler: @escaping (Error?) -> Void) {
    let html = try MarkdownRenderer.render(fileAt: url)
    webView.mainFrame.loadHTMLString(html, baseURL: nil)
    handler(nil)
    // Start watching for changes...
}
```

**2. Legacy `WebView` (deprecated, but the only option)**

The old `WebView` class (deprecated in macOS 10.14, `import WebKit`) renders HTML **in-process** — no XPC subprocesses, no sandbox issues. It supports the full WebKit CSS engine: CSS custom properties, `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`, all modern selectors. The same `preview.css` that works in a browser works here unchanged.

Why not WKWebView? It spawns `com.apple.WebKit.WebContent`, `com.apple.WebKit.GPU`, and `com.apple.WebKit.Networking` as separate XPC processes. The extension sandbox blocks all of them, resulting in a blank view.

**3. FileWatcher (DispatchSource with `O_EVTONLY`)**

A `DispatchSource.makeFileSystemObjectSource` monitors the file for `.write`, `.rename`, `.delete`, and `.attrib` events. This works inside the sandbox because the extension has read access to the previewed file.

Key details:
- **Atomic save recovery** — Editors like vim and `sed -i` delete the original file and rename a temp file in its place. The watcher detects `.rename`/`.delete` events, closes the old file descriptor, waits 50ms for the new file to settle, then re-opens at the same path.
- **100ms coalescing** — Rapid writes (e.g., `echo` in a loop) are batched via a `DispatchWorkItem` that resets on each event. Only the final state triggers a callback.
- **Main thread callback** — The callback dispatches to the main thread so it's safe to update the WebView.

**4. innerHTML injection (no flicker, no scroll loss)**

On file change, instead of reloading the entire page (which would flicker and reset scroll position), we:
1. Re-read the file and render body-only HTML via `MarkdownRenderer.renderBody()`
2. Base64-encode the HTML
3. Inject it via JavaScript: `document.querySelector('.markdown-body').innerHTML = ...`

The page frame (CSS, `<head>`, etc.) stays loaded — only the content inside `<article class="markdown-body">` swaps.

The base64 + `TextDecoder` dance is necessary because JavaScript's `atob()` produces a Latin-1 string, not UTF-8. Multi-byte characters like em-dashes (`—`) would get mangled without it:
```javascript
// This breaks UTF-8: atob(base64)
// This works: decode bytes as UTF-8
new TextDecoder().decode(Uint8Array.from(atob(base64), c => c.charCodeAt(0)))
```

### Installation matters

Finder's QuickLook **only reliably discovers extensions** from apps installed in `/Applications` or `~/Applications`. Running from Xcode's DerivedData directory causes:
- Finder shows a file icon instead of the rendered preview
- Multiple DerivedData copies create duplicate extension registrations
- Duplicate registrations cause `key cannot be nil` crashes in `ExtensionFoundation`

After every build, copy to `~/Applications` and reset the QuickLook cache:
```bash
cp -R ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/mdql-*/Build/Products/Debug/mdql.app ~/Applications/mdql.app
qlmanage -r
```

### Cross-target bundle resolution

`MarkdownRenderer.swift` is compiled into multiple targets (mdqlPreview, mdqlTests). Using `Bundle(for: PreviewController.self)` to load `preview.css` fails in the test target because `PreviewController` resolves to the test bundle, which doesn't contain the CSS. The fix is a private `BundleAnchor` class in the same file:

```swift
private class BundleAnchor {}
// ...
Bundle(for: BundleAnchor.self).url(forResource: "preview", withExtension: "css")
```

`BundleAnchor` always resolves to the bundle that contains `MarkdownRenderer.swift`, regardless of which target is running.

## Todo

- **Incremental DOM updates** — Currently, every file change replaces the entire `.markdown-body` innerHTML. This works but is wasteful: a single-character edit re-renders and re-injects the full document HTML. Instead, diff the old and new rendered HTML and patch only the changed DOM nodes. This would reduce flicker on large documents, preserve any in-page state (e.g., text selection), and improve performance for files with hundreds of sections. Changed elements should briefly highlight (e.g., a subtle flash or background pulse) so the user can instantly see what updated in the preview.

## Requirements

- macOS 12.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
